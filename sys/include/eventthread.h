 * @defgroup    sys_eventloop Global shared event loop
 * @ingroup     sys
 * @brief       Runs a thread to provide a shared execution context for events
 *
 * This module provides a standalone thread running an event loop. This thread
 * can be used to offload none time critical actions that need a thread context
 * for execution. This can be for example the regular sending of network
 * requests, low-priority housekeeping functions, or any other (none critical)
 * function for which it does not make sense to allocate a dedicated thread.
 *
 * When posting events to the global event loop, it is important to note that
 * there is no kind of guarantee on when the posted action will be processed. In
 * the default configuration, the global event loop thread has the lowest
 * possible priority (one below the idle thread), leading to posted events only
 * being processed if the CPU has nothing else to do.
 *
 * On top, the following rules should be followed when posting events to the
 * queue:
 * - don't do anything that is blocking the thread for a long time: typical
 *   network requests (e.g. a confirmable CoAP request) are the upper bound
 * - use the eventloop only for occasional tasks: if you plan on heavy
 *   utilization better use a dedicated event loop for your module
 * - make sure to adjust the stacksize depending on your usage scenario
 *
