 * @defgroup    drivers_periph_uart UART
 * @ingroup     drivers_periph
 * @brief       Low-level UART peripheral driver
 *
 * This is a basic UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) interface
 * to allow platform independent access to the MCU's serial communication abilities.
 * This interface is intentionally designed to be as simple as possible, to allow
 * for easy implementation and maximum portability. In RIOT we only use the
 * common 8-N-1 format of the serial port (8 data bits, no parity bit, one stop bit).
 *
 * The simple interface provides capabilities to initialize the serial communication
 * module, which automatically enables for receiving data, as well as writing data
 * to the UART port, which means transmitting data. The UART device and the
 * corresponding pins need to be mapped in `RIOT/boards/ * /include/periph_conf.h`.
 * Furthermore you need to select the baudrate for initialization which is typically
 * {9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200} baud. Additionally you should register a
 * callback function that is executed in interrupt context when data is being received.
 * The driver will then read the received data byte, call the registered callback
 * function and pass the received data to it via its argument. The interface enforces
 * the receiving to be implemented in an interrupt driven mode. Thus, you never know how
 * many bytes are going to be received and might want to handle that in your specific
 * callback function. The transmit function can be implemented in any way.
 *
 * By default the @p UART_DEV(0) device of each board is initialized and mapped to STDIO
 * in RIOT which is used for standard input/output functions like `printf()` or
 * `puts()`.
