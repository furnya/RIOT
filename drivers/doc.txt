/**
 * @defgroup    drivers Drivers
 * @brief       This module contains all kind of device drivers for sensors,
 *              actuators, network devices, etc.
 *
 * As **devices** in RIOT we consider hardware, that is not part of the MCU core
 * itself and that needs an interaction with an MCU (i.e. a device driver) to
 * fulfill a meaningful function. Typical devices are sensors, actuators, and
 * network devices that are connected to the MCU via some sort of bus system
 * (e.g. SPI, I2C, plain GPIO, etc.).
